                        <p>We believe that blockchain technology has the potential to empower billions of lives. However, while this technology has gone mainstream, it is still deeply misunderstood.</p>
                        <p>The potential reach of organizations in Web3 is limited by their customers’ ability to understand the technology and the organization’s capacity to create educational content about their product and Web3 in general. This educational content creation can be outsourced to Blockaday, so builders can focus on building and executives can focus on business strategy.
                        </p>
                        <p>Blockaday is a community-based Web3 EduTech company. We find innovative ways to provide curated education for individuals and organizations on the potential of blockchain technology. We present this content simply, inclusively and honestly, so a diverse audience can understand, experience and learn by doing.</p>
                        <p>As a Blockchain technology company specializing in education, we will keep innovating products and services that align with our vision and mission to add one block of knowledge everyday.</p>
