                    <h2>About Blockaday</h2>
                    <p>Blockaday is a blockchain community aiming to educate and introduce people to opportunities in the blockchain space!</p>
                    <p>Join Blockaday Discord to learn and share knowledge with our growing community!</p>
                    <div class="space">                
                        <p>We believe that blockchain technology has the potential to empower billions of lives. However, while this technology has gone mainstream, it is still deeply misunderstood.</p>
                        <p>The potential reach of organizations in Web3 is limited by their customers’ ability to understand the technology and the organization’s capacity to create educational content about their product and Web3 in general. This educational content creation can be outsourced to Blockaday, so builders can focus on building and executives can focus on business strategy.
                        </p>
                        <p>Blockaday is a community-based Web3 EduTech company. We find innovative ways to provide curated education for individuals and organizations on the potential of blockchain technology. We present this content simply, inclusively and honestly, so a diverse audience can understand, experience and learn by doing.</p>
                        <p>As a Blockchain technology company specializing in education, we will keep innovating products and services that align with our vision and mission to add one block of knowledge everyday.</p>

                             <p>Emika has been investing in crypto since early 2020, participated in blockchain hackathons, and worked as a blockchain researcher at a DeFi company and have been very active in the space since then. Starting the blockchain journey was not an easy thing. Back in those early days, Emika started it alone, then his wallet got hacked and lost all initial funds. Knowing that any actions on blockchain are irreversible, he don't want the same thing to happen to others, so he builds Blockaday to be a trustworthy community full of resources and support.</p>

                            <h3>Christian Dumas</h3>
                            <p>Christian has been fascinated by blockchain since 2017, but up until recently his involvement was limited to researching, investing, and trading. It was a lonely experience at times; he didn't have many people to talk about blockchain with. Christian wants to create a place where everyone can come together to learn and chat about this technology which he loves so much. He believes that blockchain is on course to change the world, and wants to educate as many people as possible while building the best and biggest blockchain community out there!

                            <p>Najdat will never forget the time he FOMOed into Dogecoin… not the best decision. He believes that learning about blockchain is like learning about computers and the internet in the 90s. It is a technology that is changing the way we do everything. Just like many, he felt intimidated by the amount of information he needs to learn, but he realized it didn’t have to be that way. He met likeminded people who shared similar experiences and vision, and together, they decided to build a community that can support people’s journey in this fascinating space in all possible ways.</p>
